## Stochastic Analysis

The following document is a project I initiated in January 2021 as part of my self-study of Stochastic Processes. 
As stochastic analysis is my main research interest, I thought it would essential to have a comprehensive reference covering the foundations, all the way from Measure theory to special topics in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations.

## Traveling Waves of the Hasegawa-Mima Equation

As part of my MS thesis, I am currently investigating the behavior of traveling wave solutions to the Hasegawa-Mima equation.  
The goal of this inquiry is to adress, numerically and anlytically, a certain discrepency between classical results obtained in the literature on one hand and some recent results on the other.
