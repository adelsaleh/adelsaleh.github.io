## Stochastic Analysis

The following document is a project I initiated in January 2021 as part of my self-study of Stochastic Processes. 
As stochastic analysis is my main research interest, I thought it would essential to have a comprehensive reference covering the foundations, all the way from Measure theory to special topics in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations. 
The reference also focuses on giving out fully detailed proofs, with minimal assumptions, so as to be as self-contained as possible.

## Traveling Waves of the Hasegawa-Mima Equation

As part of my MS thesis, I am currently investigating the behavior of traveling wave solutions to the Hasegawa-Mima equation.  
The goal of this inquiry is to adress, numerically and anlytically, a certain discrepency between classical results obtained in the literature on one hand, and some more recent results on the other.

## A Simulator for Quantum Algorithms

An ambitious project aimed at simulating MG-QTMs, a generalization of Stationary Rotational Quantum Turing Machines (SR-QTMs). 
It started out as a final year project for George Zakhour and Bayan Rafeh and is kept under occasional maintenance.
 I am responsible for developing and maintaining the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) of Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM for short) which simulates these QTM's. \\

## Personal Notes on Polynomial Method

These are my personal notes for the Polynomial Method course (MATH 307: Special Topics in Analysis) given by [Dr. Bassam Shayya](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/bshayya/) (American University of Beirut).   

These notes serve as an introduction to the recent method (2010-2015) used by Larry Guth (MIT) to solve the Erdos distance set conjecture.
