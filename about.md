![Alt text](/images/me.jpg){: .callout}

A curious and analytical person who seeks innovation and creativity. I enjoy
tackling difficult problems from different perspectives with focus
on intuition and simplicity, without compromising precision and rigor, and (whenever possible) provide a visualization or simulation to the solution. I  take delight in coming up with new approaches
to solve old problems, with the hope of obtaining tools to tackle the unresolved ones. I investigate connections between the many fields of Mathematics
and rely on Physics and Computer Science for intuition.
I actively develop my communication skills to relay information in the simplest and most interesting way possible.
