I'm a Mathematics graduate assistant at the American University of Beirut.
I'm a curious and analytical person who seeks innovation and creativity. I enjoy
tackling difficult problems from different perspectives with focus on intuition and simplicity, without compromising precision and rigor. I  take delight in coming up with new approaches
to solve old problems, with the hope of obtaining tools to tackle the unresolved ones. I investigate connections between the many fields of Mathematics
and rely on Physics and Computer Science for intuition.
I actively develop my communication skills to relay information in the simplest and most interesting way possible.



# Mathematics and Computer Science Projects


## Stochastic Analysis 

The following document is a project I initiated in January 2021 as part of my self-study of Stochastic Processes. 
As stochastic analysis is my main research interest, I thought it would essential to have a comprehensive reference covering the foundations, all the way from Measure theory to special topics in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations. 
The document also focuses on filling out details of the proofs given by authors in the field, with the aim being self-containment and completeness.

## Traveling Waves of the Hasegawa-Mima Equation

As part of my MS thesis, I am currently investigating the behavior of traveling wave solutions to the Hasegawa-Mima equation. 
The goal of this inquiry is to adress, numerically and analytically, a certain discrepency between classical results obtained in the literature on one hand, and some more recent results on the other.

## A Simulator for Quantum Algorithms

An ambitious project aimed at simulating MG-QTMs, a generalization of Stationary Rotational Quantum Turing Machines (SR-QTMs). 
It started out as a final year project for [George Zakhour](https://grgz.me/) and Bayan Rafeh and is kept under occasional maintenance.
I am responsible for developing and maintaining the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) of Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM for short) which simulates these QTM's.

## Personal Notes on Polynomial Method

These are my personal notes for the Polynomial Method course (MATH 307: Special Topics in Analysis) given by [Dr. Bassam Shayya](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/bshayya/) (American University of Beirut).   

These notes serve as an introduction to the recent method (2010-2015) used by Larry Guth (MIT) to solve the [Erd≈ës distinct distances problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_distinct_distances_problem ).
